\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Andrew Butterfield for supervising this project and in
particular for giving me the opportunity to get involved with the \thp{}
project. I would also like to thank Heinrich Apfelmus, the maintainer of \thp{},
for taking the time to respond to my queries.
