\utp{} is an existing computer application which is a Theorem Proving Assistant
for the Unifying Theory of Programming. The application is written in Haskell,
with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the mature WxHaskell library.

We explore the development of a second GUI for \utp{} using a Haskell library
named Threepenny-gui. Threepenny-gui provides a more consistent experience
across operating systems by using the web browser as a display, and promotes a
more functional style of writing a GUI via functional reactive programming.

Threepenny-gui is a young library in the Haskell GUI space. In using it to build
a GUI for \utp{} we realise both its potential but also discover some
limitations, contribute to its source, and publish Haskell packages which
provide extensions to Threepenny-gui.
