** WxHaskell

Wrapper around WxWidgets.

Not in Stack.

Requires non-Haskell dependencies.

Steep learning curve.

note:

Built on top of WxWidgets (formerly WxWindows) â€” a comprehensive C++ library
that is portable across all major GUI platforms; including GTK, Windows, and
macOS.

What is Stack?

Cabal hell.
