Because it's a child process.

# *** Electron as Parent

# Electron main process:

# 1. Selects a free port to run on.
# 2. Executes our Haskell binary, passing the port to run on as an argument.
# 3. Waits for Threepenny's server to start accepting connections.
# 4. Opens an Electron renderer process, loading the URL of our Threepenny app.
