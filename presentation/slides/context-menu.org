*** Context Menu

A right-click menu.

note:

Can be opened multiple ways.

---

*** Context Menu

Register handlers for "contextmenu" events.

Threepenny-gui didn't provide this facility‚ùó

note:

This is a real show of Threepenny-gui's youth.

*** Context Menu

Haskell receives ~(Int, Int)~.

Coordinates relative to source element, not page.

note:

Could use that, but it's a hack.

---

*** Context Menu

Fork which provides the correct coordinates.

---

*** Threepenny-gui-contextmenu

Nested menus with bound actions.

*** Threepenny-gui-contextmenu

#+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
[ actionMenuItem "red"   [colour el "red" ],
, actionMenuItem "blue"  [colour el "blue"],
, nestedMenuItem "more" [
    actionMenuItem "green" [colour el "green"]
  ]
]
#+END_SRC

*** Better Events

JavaScript sends specific data based on event type.

#+BEGIN_SRC Javascript
// Not used code.
switch (eventType) {
  case "contextmenu":
    return [event.x, event.y]
#+END_SRC

So, need to edit Threepenny-gui to add a new event?

---

*** Better Threepenny-gui Events

Let's just expose the entire event data.

note:

Not implemented because we have right-click menus working.
